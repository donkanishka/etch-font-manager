## 1.0.0

Initial release.

- Native **Fonts** control in the Etch Settings Bar via the official `window.etchControls` Controls API.
- Docked font manager panel styled from Etch's own design tokens, including light/dark scheme support.
- Font file uploads with magic-byte validation, 10 MB cap and path-traversal protection.
- Google Fonts search, live preview and one-click local install.
- Family and variant management (file, weight, style) with buffered edits and a save bar.
- Automatic.css mapping for `--heading-font-family` and `--text-font-family`.
- Generated stylesheet delivered to the frontend, the Etch canvas iframe and the block editor.
- Live canvas stylesheet refresh after every change, with no page reload.
